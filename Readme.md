# Friend search in distributed social networks
This is the repository of my Part 2 project at the University of Cambridge.
I am creating a distributed social search application for distributed decentralized social networks that allow the users to find their friends, independently of in which social network they have their profiles, and where that social network is hosted.

In the near future I will focus on implementing Distributed Hash Tables (Pastry, Kademilia and Chord) in Erlang to compare their merits and drawbacks (that is what I will focus on in my project as it is possibly to easily evaluate). Later, after the end of the project I will focus more on the search front end. At that point (late may next 2011) contributors are more than welcome!

## In the meantime, please consider:
- How can one avoid spammy entries in a distributed and decentralized network where anyone is free to join and contribute with data?
- How one can implement fuzzy search on top of a key-value datastore?
- How one can incorporate metadata like the a users social circles and friends of friends to give better prioritization in the search result when all the data is decentralized?
