\chapter{Introduction}
In the last few years, multiple independent distributed online social networks have been made with the explicit goal of breaking Facebook's monopoly on social networking services and give users greater control over their own data.
While I applaud these initiatives, I also see a shortcoming they all have in common. Where Facebook makes it trivial to find your friends through search, the independent online social networks --- often spanning multiple installations and providers --- require their users to know where and in which online social network installation their friends have their profiles. Not only does this make for a bad user experience, but it also limits the potential these services might have to reach wider audiences and succeed.

I set out to create a search engine that honours the ideals of the independent online social networks of giving their users control over what and how much data is made publicly available, yet allow people to find and reconnect with their friends regardless of in which online social network they decide to have their profile.

I built a proof of concept distributed search engine allowing predictive searches and fuzzy matching for misspelled and incomplete names. This search engine was built on top of Distributed Hash Tables. Each installation of an independent distributed online social network would run a copy of my software, and together make a search network available to all their users. The cost of running the search engine would be distributed between the online social networks using it, and there would be no central authority with complete control over the data. Additionally the independent online social network installations, or even individual users, could themselves decide how much and what data they make available.

I made working implementations of both the Distributed Hash Tables Chord and Pastry. The Pastry implementation being very high performance.

The search network also works as expected, providing user-friendly predictive searches showing profile images alongside search results that are updating as the user types the search query.

I also created a web application allowing me to control the network of search nodes remotely, as well as initiate experimental runs and collect experimental data for my project evaluation.
