\chapter{Evaluation}
In this chapter I will look at how the performance of Chord and Pastry compare. I will also briefly discuss the benefits of the proximity heuristic used in routing by Pastry, and finally I will discuss if Distributed Hash Tables are good back end stores for a distributed search engine of the kind I have built based on both Distributed Hash Table performance and the viability of the link record scheme proposed in the preparation chapter.

\section{What to evaluate}
% Questions to answer:
% * Are Distributed Hash Tables viable data stores for a distributed search engine?
% * Do they scale with size?
% * How do Chord and Pastry compare?
% What looked at was latency and success rate.
I will take a quantitative approach when evaluation the Distributed Hash Tables Chord and Pastry. What interests me is if they could work well as data stores in the distributed friend search engine I have built. To that extent what I will be evaluating is the latency and success rate of key lookups in the network.

We will also look at how the performance is affected by the size of the Distributed Hash Table network, and pit Chord against Pastry to see which one performs best.

\section{Experimental design}
% Discuss how started with factorial design with factors of nodes and rate.
% Found doesn't vary over length of run, so any run viable.
% All data from three separate runs.
I ran my Distributed Hash Tables on machines in the Planet-Lab network. With that in mind, the variables I was able to control were the number of machines participating in the system, the number of Distributed Hash Table nodes running on each machine, and the rate of requests in the network.

In my tests I used all the machines available to me to give some scale to the experiments, and limited the experimental factors to the number of nodes run on each machine and the rate at which requests were issued.

My experiments follow a factorial design where both node count and rate varied between 1 and 16 in powers of two. Each configuration was run at three different occasions for both Chord and Pastry. The combined log files for each experimental configuration were then used to give the results I am about to present.

\subsection{Experimental pattern}
Each experimental run followed a predefined pattern:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I would ensure that the correct number of nodes was running
\item If the number of nodes had to be adjusted, the nodes would be given 3 minutes to update their routing tables.
\item Each machine would clear its previous logs and start its logging machinery.
\item After that the actual experiment would start. Each machine would issue requests to the nodes it hosted at a rate specified for that particular experimental run.
\item After a successfully completed run, there would be a cool down period with continued logging where requests taking slightly longer than permitted would be allowed to finish. Logging would then stop and the logs from the individual machines would be collected at the central hub node.
\item The logs were then downloaded from the central hub to my personal machine for safekeeping and analysis.
\item The process was then repeated for different experimental parameters.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Effects of Planet-Lab}
As mentioned my experiments ran on top of machines provided by Planet-Lab. I was allowed to run up to 100 machines, but never managed to get quite that many up and running at the same time.

Using Planet-Lab as a test bed gave me several benefits: the machines at my disposal had a high geographical spread and varied greatly in what computational resources they provided. Depending on the time of day the computational load on the machines would also vary and not only that, but I would have a different subset of the machines available for testing from day to day.

This provided an excellent foundation for testing Distributed Hash Tables which are meant to be able to cope with high node churn and machines with widely different capabilities.

While Planet-Lab provides an interesting test bed, the randomness with which computational resources are available makes it impossible to accurately repeat experiments. Rerunning an experiment would invariably give a slightly different result.
To work with Planet-Lab's strengths and not against it, and at the same time to get data I could have confidence in, I ran each experiment multiple times, shifted in time. This way I ensured I would sample different subsets of the topology. I believe this gave me results that while having higher variance, also more closely resemble the real world scenario Distributed Hash Tables are likely to find themselves in.

\subsection{Experimental cleanliness and validity of results}
Performing experiments over longer periods of time showed that the success rate (figure \ref{figLatencyAgainstTime}) and latency (figure \ref{figRateAgainstTime}) for all practical purposes stay constant over time. This allowed me to cut down the length of individual experimental runs without lowering the quality of my results.

    \label{figRateAgainstTime}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% * How logging not affect results
During experimental runs I would turn of all functionality not directly needed for serving the requests. This would include turning of the mechanisms that kept the nodes routing tables up to date. If a node disappeared during an experiment, nodes contacting it directly would take note of it, but other nodes wouldn't have the nodes disappearance reflected in their routing state like they would under normal operation. This might seem a somewhat unnatural choice, but makes sense for my experiments for the following reasons:

In my experimental builds of Chord and Pastry I had turned up the rate a which routing information was dissipated through the network to an extreme to cut down the waiting time between experimental runs. Since what I wanted to test was the raw performance of the system, removing the overhead of keeping the routing tables up to date made sense, since this overhead differs between Chord and Pastry, and is a parameter that would have to be tweaked before using this system in any real world deployment.
Also having established that the length of the experimental runs was insignificant made me confident in that not updating routing information during experimental runs did no harm to the experimental results.

% * How load spread evenly
\mbox{}
To ensure even load across my test network, each machine involved individually issued requests to the Distributed Hash Table network.
The keys looked up were randomly generated by hashing a combination of the Ip-address of the machine issuing the request and a time stamp. This approach results in keys that differ from experimental run to experimental run. While this makes doing repeatable experiments impossible, it nicely models a real world spread of keys that otherwise would be hard to predict and also evenly spreads the loads between the machines.

% * What constitutes a valid run
Data from experimental runs where a significant number of machines disappeared during the run would be discarded.


\section{Results}
Throughout my experiments, a valid request is defined as a request that completes within 5 seconds. By that definition, all other requests are invalid, regardless of if they fail to complete at all, or if they just complete after more than 5 seconds have passed.

\subsection{Mean latency and success rate for Chord and Pastry}
In figure \ref{figChordLatency} and \ref{figPastryLatency} you see the latency for different rates and different number of nodes per machine for around 60 machines, shown with 95\% confidence intervals. 

What is immediately noticeable is how much more variance there is in the latencies for Chord than there is in the latencies for Pastry.
In the case of Pastry (figure \ref{figPastryLatency}) we see how the latencies consistently grow for larger number of nodes. Intuitively this is what we would expect as the theory behind the Distributed Hash Tables tells us the number of nodes involved in a look up is proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the network and the higher the number of nodes, the more the inter-node connectivity latency plays a role. The same trend is not apparent for Chord (figure \ref{figChordLatency}). On the contrary there is no apparent correlation between the number of nodes and the latency for a given rate. What is also peculiar in the Chord dataset is that, looking at the latencies for a fixed number of nodes per host, the latencies seem to decrease for higher loads.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/latency_chord.eps}

    \caption{This graph shows the instantaneous rate of requests and the instantaneous rate of successfully completed requests sampled once per second for Pastry. An experimental setup with slightly more than 60 nodes was used.}

    \label{figChordSuccessRate}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The success rate is also dramatically different between Chord (figure \ref{figChordSuccessRate}) and Pastry (\ref{figPastrySuccessRate}). Chord seems to perform better when more than one node is run on the same machine, while Pastry's success rate slightly decreases the more nodes are run on the same physical hardware. It is also worth noting that even at its best, Chord can't compare with the worst case performance of Pastry.

Unfortunately I have no good explanation for the variations we see within the different configurations for Chord, but I can explain why Chord in general performs so much worse than Pastry, and I will do so shortly.

Before that I want to discuss how Chord and Pastry behave when pushed to their limits. The cumulative distribution functions for Chord (figure \ref{figChordCDF}) and Pastry (figure \ref{figPastryCDF}) show the percentage of requests that succeed within five seconds. The experiments are run on roughly 60 machines hosting 1 node each. We see how the success rate gracefully drops for extreme rates with Pastry.
In the case of Chord on the other hand, the success rate is only marginally worse for 128 and 64 requests per second per hosts than when there are 16 requests per second per machine. Also rather odd is how the rate of 2 requests per second performs significantly worse than what does the rate of 4 in the case of Chord. I have no good explanations for this behaviour.

Please also notice how the cumulative distribution function graph seems to plateau relatively quickly after around twice the average latency. What this seems to tell us is that if a request does not succeed within a relative short window of time, the probability of it still completing successfully is vanishingly small. This knowledge could be used to set sensible time-out values for lookups.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Why Chord performs worse that Pastry}
The experimental evidence shown so far shows Pastry as superior to Chord both in terms of latency and in the success rate of requests. I will now try to explain in turn what the causes might be.

\mbox{}

The higher latencies of Chord are the easiest to explain. In figure \ref{figChordNumNodes} and \ref{figPastryNumNodes} you see how many nodes are involved in key lookups for Chord and Pastry respectively. It is clear from the graph that the average number of nodes involved in a key lookup are greater for Chord than for Pastry. If one multiplies the average time it takes two randomly chosen nodes to connect with the number of nodes involved in a key lookup, it should be clear that a Chord lookup should take longer if the only thing one is accounting for is the latency of the routing. Additionally Pastry uses a heuristic when routing, favouring nodes closer by, which also affects the latency as each routing step is likely to take less time for Pastry than it does for Chord. I will shortly discuss the impact of the proximity heuristic in Pastry.

Whether the higher number of routing steps for Chord is a bug introduced by me or something inherent to the Chord algorithm is something I can't comment on. It is also possible that the difference would become less significant for larger networks of nodes. Unfortunately this is not something I was able to test given the infrastructure available to me.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/nodes_against_time_chord.eps}
    \caption{This graph shows the number of nodes involved in a key lookup in a particular experimental run for Chord.}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htb]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/nodes_against_time_pastry.eps}
    \caption{This graph shows the number of nodes involved in a key lookup in a particular experimental run for Chord.}
    \label{figPastryNumNodes}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\mbox{}
Now that we have an idea of why the latency might be higher for Chord than for Pastry, let me try to explain why the failure rate is higher as well.

First let us recall how Chord and Pastry perform their routing.
In Chord, the node that wants to lookup a key (the requester) asks the node closest to the key that it knows about if it knows about other nodes closer to the target key. It then asks the node it gets returned the same question, and the pattern continues until it finds the node immediately preceding the key. Its successor is the target node responsible for the key.

Pastry follows a different approach. When a requesting node looks up a key it makes a request to the node it knows about that is closest to the target node. Where it differs from the Chord approach is that the requester hands over the responsibility for the continued lookup to the node it asked. This node in turns then asks another node until the target node has been reached.

Now lets consider what happens when something goes wrong.
In figure \ref{figChordFailedLookup} we see what happens when Chord node A gets returned node D as the next hop node from B. D is not accessible and the lookup fails. If A retries the routing step, B again returns D, unless it in the meantime itself has noticed that D is inaccessible.

In the case of Pastry node B becomes responsible for routing the request forward towards the target node. Upon realising node D is unavailable it routes it to the next closest node it knows about, in this case C. Node C happens to know about a node closer to the target than D, and this way we managed to route around the unavailable node.

There are workarounds for improving Chord's routing performance. One would be for the requesting node A to inform node B about node D's death upon retrying to route the message. An alternative could also have been for node A to try to route the request through another intermediate node before D, but in this case we are not guaranteed that this intermediate node will not also return D.
A third approach could be to look up D's predecessor, and then use that node in the same role previously filled by B. None of these methods have been used in my implementation as they would extend the core Chord routing algorithm and therefore skew the comparison in Chord's favour.

\section{Effect of Pastry routing heuristics}
% * What effect does the Pastry routing heuristics have on the performance
In this section I will look at how the heuristics used in my implementation of Pastry affect the routing performance. 

I have sampled the latencies from Pastry in a small set of different configurations with the heuristic enabled and then with the heuristic turned off. Please note that this is nothing but a very limited sample and by no means an exhaustive evaluation of the heuristic, or heuristics in general. One should not try to generalize the findings based on this data or read it as valid for anything but the sampled configurations.

The following configurations were sampled:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10 machines running 1 node each
\item 10 machines running 5 nodes each
\item 50 machines running 1 node each
\item 50 machines running 16 nodes each
\end{itemize}

The choice of configurations were made for the following reason:
I wanted to see how expanding the network by adding additional machines at new geographical locations affect the latency.
I also wanted to see how running 50 nodes across a few machines compared to running 50 nodes on 50 different machines. Lastly I also wanted to see how the heuristic behaved in the more extreme case with a larger network with relatively large cliques of nodes close to each other.

The results seen in figure \ref{figPastryHeuristic} partly show what one would expect, in other words that the heuristic improves the routing performance.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/pastry_heuristic.eps}
    \caption{Latencies for Pastry with and without the routing proximity heuristic activated. Shown with 95\% confidence intervals.}
    \label{figPastryHeuristic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As one would expect, the heuristic allowing nodes to preferentially route to geographically closer nodes for the most part improved the performance substantially. In the two cases where only 1 node were run per host we see a 15\% and 10\% gain for the 10 machine and 50 machine cases respectively.
Quite surprisingly, the cases where multiple nodes are located on the same machine, a scenario where I would have expected the heuristic to shine, perform less well. In the case where 50 nodes are spread over 10 hosts we only see a 4\% performance gain when using the heuristic, and in the case where 50 machines run 16 nodes each, the performance drops by 20\% when the heuristic is being used.

Unfortunately I have no conclusive evidence indicating what could cause the performance drop when there are many nodes running on the same machine. The heuristic is only calculated when nodes are added to the routing table, and should therefore not affect the routing performance locally within a node.

Maybe the heuristic of hop count in the underlying network is just suboptimal.

Nothing much can be concluded from this, other than that heuristics do not necessarily result in performance gains unless chosen carefully. This outcome also highlights the importance of relying on metrics when making design decisions rather than blindly implementing performance enhancements in the faith that optimisations are always for the better.

Less interesting, but reassuring non the less, is that the latency grows with increasing number of nodes in the network, just like one would expect. Unfortunately this dataset does not allow for a general measure of how the latency grows with the network size.

\section{Cost of the link record approach for achieving fuzzy and predictive search}
As introduced in the preparation chapter, my implementation uses \emph{link records}, records pointing to full \emph{profile records} in order to provide predictive and fuzzy search.

I will now evaluate how this affects the storage requirements of the Distributed Hash Table network, and also the number of key lookups that need be done for a particular search.

First, let us look at the how the storage requirements are affected.
I have a sample of 170 million names taken from Facebook. This sample might not follow the distribution of names in the real world, but most certainly quite accurately models the kind of names people give themselves in online social networks.

I created \emph{link records} for 20 million of these names, and can with 99\% confidence say that the social network population mean name would require 5.322 $\pm$ 0.001 link records. I can also say that the population mean average length of a name is 14.959 $\pm$ 0.002 characters.

If each link record consists of a users full name, the key of the \emph{profile record} and the key of the \emph{link record} itself, then the storage requirement of each \emph{link record} is roughly 2kbit, or 10kbit per \emph{profile record}.
In my opinion this is not an issue.

Now, let us consider the amount of extra lookups that would be required for a predictive search using link records. Figure \ref{figKeyLookup1} and figure \ref{figKeyLookup2} show the amount of link records that have to be downloaded when the user adds an extra character to the name being searched for. The data is based on link records generate for a sample of 40 million names evenly distributed in the bag of names taken off of Facebook.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/LinkRecordLookups.png}
\caption{This illustration shows how many new link records result from an extra character in a search for the name Atchaya Pruedsakaran and the amount of data stored under that particular key. The data is from a sample of link records for 40 million names for the facebook database of names. Lines in bold indicate when one or more of the new link records point to the profile record for the full name we are searching for.}
\label{figKeyLookup1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{illustrations/LinkRecordLookups2.png}
\caption{This illustration shows how many new link records result from an extra character in a search for the name Brad Catron and the amount of data stored under that particular key. The data is from a sample of link records for 40 million names for the facebook database of names. Lines in bold indicate when one or more of the new link records point to the profile record for the full name we are searching for.}
\label{figKeyLookup2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

What we clearly see is that there seem to be a lot of link records for 1 character names (400k for a and 17k for b) and when the search term contains one or more three character words. That high number of link records for three character words can be explained by the fact that link records are generated for each additional three characters in a name.

What gives this approach some hope is that there are far less link records for 6 character name fragments (11 for atchay, 190 for catron and 1 for prueds in the examples shown in figure \ref{figKeyLookup1} and \ref{figKeyLookup2}). I therefore believe that if one generates link records for each additional 4th or 5th character in a name instead of for every 3rd, one would see a significant drop in the number of link records system wide.

Caching link records for all character combinations up to 3 characters unfortunately proves infeasible. Back of the envelope calculations based on the numbers presented would indicate that each host would need more than 1TB of local caches, and probably more than that if the system was also to accommodate non-latin character sets.

It would therefore be interesting to evaluate what benefits could be gotten from generating link records for longer name fragments. Unfortunately there was no time for evaluating this hypothesis.

Another performance enhancing procedure would also be to not start looking for link records unless the search term has reached a certain minimal length.

Also notice how in both search cases illustrated, a link record for the correct person has already been found after a search for the first three characters. In the case of the search for Brad Catron, we could already suggest the full name as the user types in Brad C, without having to look for extra link records by just filtering based on the full name component of the link records.


\subsection{Viability of Chord and Pastry as back end data stores for a search engine}
% Conclude
% * Does it work for search engine?
In its current raw form, Chord is not really a viable data store for any application. Its high and variable latency, although undesirable, is something one could live with, if the key lookups would not have such a high failure rate.

Pastry on the other hand proves a quite efficient key-value store, even in highly distributed environments. Its combination of high success rates and consistently low key lookup latencies and gradual degradation in performance under high load are all desirable properties.

If one uses a slightly more advanced and optimized version of the \emph{link record} scheme I have proposed, I think key-value stores could quite efficiently be used as the back end data store for a search engine. Especially considering the benefits Distributed Hash Tables bring along of built in load balancing, fault tolerance and predictable and scalable performance.

If search servers also cache link records they have previously loaded and not just na\"ively loads new link records for every key-stroke the users types while searching, then I believe Distributed Hash Tables can be used quite successfully.

\mbox{}

In this chapter we have seen how my implementation of Pastry outperforms my implementation of Chord both in terms of latency and key lookup success rate.
We have also discovered how the proximity heuristic used in routing by Pastry quite counter intuitively does not always yield performance improvements, and have understood the importance of relying on metrics rather than intuition when evaluating system performance.

We also looked at the impact using link records has on the amount of data that needs to be stored in the network and the number of link records loaded during two sample searches.

Finally we concluded that with a slightly altered link record scheme, Distributed Hash Tables can work quite well as the data store for a Distributed Search engine of the particular kind I have proposed.
