\chapter{Conclusion}
In my project I created a search engine to be run by independent and distributed online social networks. The search engine honours a fundamental ideal of independent online social networks by allowing their users control over what and how much data about them is made publicly available. I also solve the problem of allowing users of independent online distributed social networks to find and reconnect with their friends regardless of in which online social network they have their profile.

I built this service on top of Distributed Hash Tables and invented a scheme for enabling fuzzy and predictive searches across key-value stores. This scheme works well in its current form for installations with small to medium sized data sets, and could work well in larger installations if optimized.

As part of my project I implemented two Distributed Hash Tables. While both work correctly, my implementation of Pastry works significantly better than Chord, giving impressive results.

My project was highly successful as a proof of concept, but would need further refinement before being deployed by real social networks, which is in line with what I set out to do.

While being a success in its own right, the project has also been an excellent learning experience.
I had never used the programming language Erlang for anything but trivial ``hello world" applications before the start of my project and now have a solid working knowledge of it and its libraries. I also got significant exposure to working with highly distributed systems and deploying software across up to 100 machines.
The same project implemented again from the beginning would cost me significantly less time and effort considering all the knowledge I now possess. This itself can also be considered a success, considering knowledge acquisition is a central component of what role I believe the Part II projects are designed to achieve.

As a whole the project solves a very real problem that needed addressing to help independent distributed social networks stand a fighting chance in gaining market share against Facebook. There is still a lot of work to be done, but my project serves an important role in highlighting an obstacle that needs addressing and proposed a solution for how it can be tackled.
